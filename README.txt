KID-LEVEL INSTRUCTIONS (short):
1) Put this whole folder on a web address that starts with https (use ngrok if you want).
2) Copy that https link (example: https://abc123.ngrok-free.app).
3) Open manifest.xml and paste that link in place of PASTE_YOUR_HTTPS_URL_HERE.
4) Create any GUID online and paste it where it says PASTE_A_GUID_HERE.
5) In Outlook Web: Settings (gear) -> My add-ins -> Custom add-ins -> Upload from file -> pick manifest.xml.
6) Open a calendar event -> click 'Attendance Helper' -> 'Open Helper'. If you see the page, it works!
